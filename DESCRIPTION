Description: Provides an extension to 'ggplot2'
  (Wickham, 2016, <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4>) for creating two types of
  continuous confidence interval plots (Violin CI and Gradient CI plots),
  typically for the sample mean. These plots contain multiple user-defined
  confidence areas with varying colours, defined by the underlying
  t-distribution used to compute standard confidence intervals for the mean of
  the normal distribution when the variance is unknown. Two types of plots are
  available, a gradient plot with rectangular areas, and a violin plot where
  the shape (horizontal width) is defined by the probability density function
  of the t-distribution. These visualizations are studied in
  (Helske, Helske, Cooper, Ynnerman, and Besancon, 2021)
